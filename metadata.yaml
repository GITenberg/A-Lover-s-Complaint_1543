description: When this volume of Shakespeare's poems first appeared in 1609, he had
  already written most of the great plays that made him famous. The 154 sonnets -
  all but two of which are addressed to a beautiful young man or a treacherous 'dark
  lady' - contain some of the most exquisite and haunting poetry ever written, and
  deal with eternal subjects such as love and infidelity, memory and mortality, and
  the destruction wreaked by Time. Also included is A Lover's Complaint, originally
  published with the sonnets, in which a young woman is overheard lamenting her betrayal
  by a heartless seducer.
